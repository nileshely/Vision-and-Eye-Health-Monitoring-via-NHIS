# NHIS Vision and Eye Health Surveillance

**Description:**

The NHIS Vision and Eye Health Surveillance Dataset is a comprehensive collection of de-identified summary data on various indicators related to vision and eye health, sourced from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics at the CDC. This dataset offers insights into trends in visual function across different age groups, race/ethnicities, genders, and risk factors, drawn from approximately 35,000 households and 87,500 individuals each year. Data points are meticulously curated, with suppression applied to cell sizes below 30 persons or instances where the relative standard error exceeds 30% of the mean, ensuring data reliability. Updates are made regularly as new information becomes available, making this dataset a valuable resource for monitoring and understanding patterns in eye health at a national level.
